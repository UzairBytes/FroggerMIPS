# FroggerMIPS
Implementation of Frogger as a CSC258: Computer Architecture final project at the University of Toronto. The assignment instructions are in the PDF. It was made in MIPS Assembly using MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator). If you don't have it installed, you can get it from https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm before you download the code and run it. The display and keyboard settings for correct usage are in the assembly file.

If you are a student who has been given this assignment for CSC258 or any similar course at a different university, please do not copy and paste my code. You'll risk serious consequences for plagiarism and you won't learn anything.
